# Homework-2
The second homework for my Data Structures class

It involves solving the popular Knight's Tour problem in which given a position on a chessboard, the program will calculate all permutations of a chessboard given the following constraints:

     1. Each space can only be visited once
     2. Each space must be visited by a knight
     3. A knight can move to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one        square horizontally.
     
The program finally prints the total number of permutations, but only after printing all possible permutations.
